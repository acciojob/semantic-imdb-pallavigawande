			Young Kizie Basu is suffering from thyroid cancer and is dependent on an oxygen cylinder all her life. She feels that her life is boring and she dreams of meeting singer Abhimanya Veer, who has left one of his songs incomplete. During cancer counseling sessions she meets Immanuel Rajkumar Junior, a fan of Superstar Rajnikanth and also suffering from Osteosarcoma. Immanuel and his friend JP, who suffers from glaucoma, are making a film similar to Rajnikant's film and offer Kizie a lead role. During this phase, Kizzie's life changes and blossoms and she falls in love, but death can call them anytime.
